# AntiJam Project

This is a Reinforcement Learning system that trains
a traffic light agent to optimally switch based on
real time traffic observations.

The optimization goal is the minimization
of wasted fuel - fuel used while stuck in traffic.

Each traffic light sees cars in the entire city,
other traffic light states and it's own position.

The PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent has
been trained in such an environment.

Results have been compared with a baseline
model (switching lights every X ticks).
The learned PPO agent outperforms the baseline.
